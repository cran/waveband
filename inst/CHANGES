From 4.5 to 4.6:	Moved all references from nlevels() to nlevelsWT()

4.7:	Introduced the JRSSB paper reference into some of the help files.
	Added registration of S3Methods and also imports directives to NAMESPACE
	Also added restriction to only analyse vectors of length >= 8,
	as wd doesn't deal well with small length vectors by default 
	Added print.wb and summary.wb methods
	Added init.c to src directory and registered native routines.

4.7.1   Move some C source code (comwr, comcbr and commul) from wavethresh
	to here. This is because R packages no longer permit borrowing
	code from other packages.

4.7.2	Added C prototypes for all functions in response to request from
	R team

4.7.3	Removed obsolete FORTRAN after email from Brian

4.7.4	Removed or replaced obsolescent code in as99.f and as100.f Replaced Computed GOTOs in as100.f. Commented out SNV subroutine as it was
	not used by waveband. Remaining compiler warning is complaining about the possibility of an uninitialized variable S. I've checked code and
	by dependence on a logical variable L, S can not be used uninitialized. So, this warning can safely be ignored
